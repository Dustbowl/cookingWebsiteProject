Pull kale leaves from stems and tear them into small 1-2 inch pieces. Rinse the kale well in a colander under cool, running water and allow it to drain. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Break the pasta in half, add it to the boiling water, and cook about 7 minutes. Drain the pasta in a colander. While the pasta is cooking, add the olive oil, butter, and minced garlic to another large pot or skillet. Cook over medium heat for 1-2 minutes, or until the garlic is soft and fragrant. Add the kale and continue to sauté until the kale has wilted and has turned a deep green color or about 5-7 minutes. Turn the heat off. Add the drained pasta to the pot with the sautéed kale. Toss the pasta and kale together. Allow them to cool. You want the pasta warm, but not hot enough to melt the Parmesan. Season the pasta and kale with salt and pepper. Add the grated Parmesan cheese and toss to coat.
